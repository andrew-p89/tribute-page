    <h2>About J.R.R. Tolkien</h2>
    <p>
        John Ronald Reuel Tolkien (1892–1973) was a major scholar of the English language, specialising in Old and Middle English. Twice Professor of Anglo-Saxon (Old English) at the University of Oxford, he also wrote a number of stories, including most famously <em>The Hobbit</em> (1937) and <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> (1954–1955), which are set in a pre-historic era in an invented version of our world which he called by the Middle English name of Middle-earth. This was peopled by Men (and women), Elves, Dwarves, Trolls, Orcs (or Goblins) and of course Hobbits. He has regularly been condemned by the Eng. Lit. establishment, with honourable exceptions, but loved by literally millions of readers worldwide. <a href="https://www.tolkiensociety.org/author/biography/" target="_blank">(The Tolkien Society)</a>
